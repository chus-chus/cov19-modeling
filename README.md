This is the code used for the preprocessing, training, evaluation, fine-tuning and feature importance extraction steps for the paper

"Symptoms-based predictive models of the covid-19 disease in children".

See `model_analysis.ipynb` notebook for an in-depth guide of the modeling process and the extraction of feature importances, and find the data preprocessing steps in the `Preprocessing_pipeline.ipynb` notebook.

The notebook format allows for easy prototyping and is great for following along, especially for a paper aimed at a non-technical public such as this one.
